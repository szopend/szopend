👋 Hi, I'm @szopend, a web developer with a passion for crafting immersive 
digital experiences. My toolkit includes JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS.

👀 I'm currently delving into the world of web development through courses 
on Codecademy, enhancing my skills to stay at the forefront of technology.

🌱 Eager to collaborate on exciting web projects, I'm especially interested in contributing to 
the success of small companies looking to establish a compelling online presence.
